### welcome!

hi and welcome to this little nest of mine.  
i had always wanted a personal website but procrastinated on creating one for a long time until this week, i finally got the kick and did it >:)

### about me

i am a CSE undergrad - currently in my final year. i started learning to program when i was in my 10th grade - it's been a fun ride, hah.  
i was a part of Google Summer of Code 2023, read about my experience [here.](https://gist.github.com/juuz0/0912b00616e2e5a38e07586b50502f38)

### 'stuff that interests me'

- **programming/development**
- **open-source**
- **football** - the messi-ronaldo one
- **games** - i play either mobile or browser games (brawl stars, pokemon unite, text-based natsims)

### about this website

i love changing designs and i will probably do it any random weekend so maybe next time you read this (and if you are, send me a message!) it'll look drastically different.  
my goal with this website is to have a little fun place to write and experiment, to share things i know.

thank you for reading and happy new year.
